---+ Introduction 

This is a text file written in Org-mode ([[http://www.orgmode.org][http://www.orgmode.org]]), and it is used as a test case for my Org-to-DocBook exporter.  Each section contains some feature in Org-mode... 
 

---+ About Sections and Subsections 

DocBook supports numbered sections and also _recursive_ sections.  We choose recursive sections (element =&lt;section&gt;=) in DocBook exporter to make generated DocBook documents much more portable.  Sections can be freely moved to different places, either in an article or in a book, at different levels. 
 
As Org files tend to contain a lot of headings, which are transformed to _empty_ sections in DocBook.  Empty paragraphs, like =&lt;para&gt;&lt;/para&gt;=, are added for such sections to make generated XML document valid. 
 

---++ Subsection x.1 


---+++ Empty Subsection x.1.1 


 

---+++ Subsection x.1.2 


 

---++ Subsection x.2 


---+++ Subsection x.2.1 


---++++ Subsection x.2.1.1 


---+++++ Subsection x.2.1.1.1 (Level 5) 


---++++++ Subsection x.2.1.1.1.1 (Level 6) 


---+++++++ Subsection x.2.1.1.1.1.1 (Level 7) 


---++++++++ Subsection x.2.1.1.1.1.1.1 (Level 8) 


 

---++ Subsection x.3 


 

---+ About Images 

Here is an image with caption and label: 
 
{{:GNU.png|GNU.png}}
Caption of image GNU.png
 

 
You can also add attributes to element =&lt;imagedata&gt;= via =#+ATTR_DocBook:= line to control how an image is displayed.  You can customize variable =org-export-docbook-default-image-attributes= to set the default attributes that you want to append to all the images in your Org file. 
 
{{:org-mode-unicorn.svg|org-mode-unicorn.svg}}
Org-mode Logo (Unicorn) in SVG Format (width="3in")
 

 
In Org-mode, an image file can be used as the description of a link, and the image is exported as a click-able image in HTML export.  In DocBook format, the image file path is formatted as it is.  See the following link: [[//Users/bcui/Downloads/tdg5/en/html/docbook.html][/Users/bcui/Org/docbook-cover.png]]

---+ About Timestamps, TODOs, and Tags 

This is a timestamp &lt;2009-03-02 Mon&gt;.  
 
For TODOs, we can simply put the TODO keywords in =[...]= to make them stand out in section titles.  For tags, they are formatted as superscript.  We may need to find other better-looking formats. 
 

---++ [TODO] My First Item. :work:urgent:


 

---++ [DONE] My Second Item. 


 

---++ [TODO] My Third Item. :home:_old:


 

---+ Inline Tasks (TODOs) 

This sections contains some inline task: 
 
⇒⇒⇒ *TODO some small task*
 
<verbatim>
                 And here is some extra text

</verbatim>
⇒⇒⇒ *TODO This is the first inline TODO*
 
I need to do that following thing for the first TODO: 
 
   1. First item for first TODO  
   1. Second item for first TODO  
⇒⇒⇒ *TODO This is the second inline TODO*
 
This is my second TODO. 
 
⇒⇒⇒ *TODO This is the third inline TODO*
 
This is my third TODO.

---+ About Tables 


---++ Regular Tables 

If a table has a caption, then it will be formatted as a regular table in DocBook using element =&lt;table&gt;=.  Here is an example table that has a caption "My Phone Book": 
 
| *First Name* | *Last Name* | *Tele #* | 
| Baoqiu | Cui | 123-4567 | 
| David | Smith | 999-9999 | 
| John | Dean | 888-8888 | 
| Scott | Fisher | 111-1111 | 

---++ Informal Tables 

Tables without a caption will be formatted as informal tables in DocBook using element =&lt;informaltable&gt;=.  Such tables do not have a caption. See this example: 
 
| *Item* | *Owner* | *Due Date* | *Status* | 
| 1 | Baoqiu | 2009-03-10 | Returned | 
| 2 | Scott | 2009-03-20 | On Hold | 
| 3 | John | 2009-04-20 | Overdue | 

---+ About Verses and Quotes 

If the source of a verse or quote (a.k.a. _attribution_ in DocBook) is found in the verse or quote, an =&lt;attribution&gt;= element will be added to element =&lt;blockquote&gt;=.  This helps format verses or quotes more nicely. 
 

---++ Verses 

The following is a verse with attribution ("=-- AlexSchroeder=", which appears in the _last_ line in the verse): 
 
AlexSchroederGreat clouds overhead Tiny black birds rise and fall Snow covers Emacs  The next one is a verse _without_ attribution: 
 
O, for a muse of fire, that would ascend The brightest heaven of invention! A kingdom for a stage, princes to act, And monarchs to behold the swelling scene! 
---++ Block Quotes 

This is a block quote with attribution ("=-- Albert Einstein=", which appears in the _last_ line of the quote). 
 
Albert EinsteinEverything should be made as simple as possible, but not any simpler.   
 
Here is one block quote that has two paragraphs but no attribution: 
 
God does not care about our mathematical difficulties. He integrates empirically. 
 
Great spirits have always found violent opposition from mediocrities. The latter cannot understand it when a man does not thoughtlessly submit to hereditary prejudices but honestly and courageously uses his intelligence. 
 

---+ About Literal Examples 

You can include literal examples that should not be subjected to markup.  Such examples will be typeset in monospace, so this is well suited for source code and similar examples.   
 
<verbatim>
    Some example from a text file.  This can include characters like '<'
    and '>', etc.
    
    The following line should not be regarded as the continuation of a long
    footnote: 
\par This is NOT part of a footnote.

    The following empty DocBook paragraph has property 'org-protected,
    and thus should NOT be removed during the final cleanup time.

    <para>
    </para>

    The following empty section is also protected, so should NOT be
    filled with an empty paragraph ("<para></para>") by DocBook
    exporter:

    <section xml:id="sec-2.1.1">
    <title>Empty Subsection x.1.1 </title>
    </section>

</verbatim>
For simplicity when using small examples, you can also start the example lines with a colon followed by a space.  There may also be additional whitespace before the colon: 
 
Here is an example: 
 
<verbatim>
    #include <iostream>
    #include <iterator>
    using namespace std;
    
    int main(int ac, char* av[])
    {
        try {
          ...
        }
        catch(exception& e) {
            cerr << "error: " << e.what() << "\n";
            return 1;
        }
        catch(...) {
            cerr << "Exception of unknown type!\n";
        }
    
        return 0;
    }

</verbatim>

---+ About Drawers 

Drawers are something that people normally do not want to see.  So they should not appear in the DocBook output.  This is just to confirm that. 
 

---++ This is a headline 

Still outside the drawer. After the drawer. 
 

---+ About Typesetting 

The following markups are supported in Org-mode: <u>underline</u>, *emphasize*, =code=, _italic_, =verbatim=, <strike>strike-through</strike>. 
 
More examples: 
 
   * =[!#&amp;*+-/:;&lt;=&gt;?]= 
   * =[\t\n\r ,]= 

---+ About Lists 


---++ Itemized Lists 

This is paragraph one.  This is paragraph one.  This is paragraph one. This is paragraph one.  This is paragraph one.  This is paragraph one. This is paragraph one.  This is paragraph one. 
 
This is paragraph two.  This is paragraph two.  This is paragraph two. This is paragraph two.  This is paragraph two.  This is paragraph two. This is paragraph two.  This is paragraph two. 
 
This is an itemized list: 
 
   * Item one.  
   * Item two.  

---++ Ordered Lists 

This is an ordered list: 
 
   1. Number One.  
      %BR%%BR%
      Another paragraph for number one item.  
      %BR%%BR%
      Another another paragraph for number one item.  
   1. Number Two.  

---++ Definition Lists 

This is a variable list (a.k.a. Variable Lists in DocBook): 
 
   $ Term One: Term 1 definition.  Term 1 definition.  Term 1 definition.  Term 1 definition.  Term 1 definition. Term 1 definition.  Term 1 definition.  
   $ Term Two: Term 2 definition.  Term 2 definition.  Term 2 definition.  Term 2 definition.  Term 2 definition. Term 2 definition.  Term 2 definition.  Term 2 definition.  Term 2 definition.  

---++ Check Box Lists 

This is a check box list: 
 
   * =[-]= Check boxes [2/3]  
      * =[X]= Check box 1  
      * =[ ]= Check box 2  
      * =[X]= Check box 3  

---++ Nested Lists with Different List Types 

This is a 3-level nested list: 
 
   * Item one.  
     %BR%%BR%
     This item contains a description list (or _variable list_ in DocBook):  
      $ Term ONE: This is term one.  
      $ Term TWO: This is term two.  
         1. Description one.  
            %BR%%BR%
            Second paragraph in description one.  
            %BR%%BR%
            Third paragraph in description one.  After this paragraph, we have two consecutive lists with different list types.  These two lists should be exported correctly as _two_ different lists:  
            1. Ordered list item one  
            1. Ordered list item two  
            * Itemized list item one  
            * Itemized list item two  
            * Itemized list item three  
         1. Description two.  
            <verbatim>
Code in description two (line 1)
Code in description two (line 2)

</verbatim>
         1. Description three.  
        Another paragraph for "Term TWO".  
     Another paragraph for "Item one".  
   * Item two.  

---+ Random Pieces 


---++ Lord of the Rings 

My favorite scenes are (in this order) 
 
   1. The attack of the Rohirrim  
   1. Eowyn's fight with the witch king  
      * this was already my favorite scene in the book  
      * I really like Miranda Otto.  
   1. Peter Jackson being shot by Legolas  
      * on DVD only  
      He makes a really funny face when it happens.  
But in the end, no individual scenes matter but the film as a whole. Important actors in this film are: 
 
   $ Elijah Wood: He plays Frodo  
   $ Sean Austin: He plays Sam, Frodo's friend.  I still remember him very well from his role as Mikey Walsh in the Goonies.  

---+ About Code Reference Labels 

The following is a two-line program listing.  Since options "=-n -r=" are specified, we display the line numbers but remove the code reference labels. 
 
<verbatim>
1:  (save-excursion
2:     (goto-char (point-min))

</verbatim>
In line 1 we remember the current positon.  Line 2 jumps to point-min. 
 
The following listing continues from the previous one (option "=+n=" is specified).  Since option "=-r=" does not exist, code reference labels are _not_ removed: 
 
<verbatim>
3:  (defgroup org-export-docbook nil
4:    "Options for exporting Org-mode files to DocBook."  (doc)
5:    :tag "Org Export DocBook"                           (tag)
6:    :group 'org-export)

</verbatim>
Line (doc) is the group documentation, and line (tag) is the group tag. 
 

---+ About Subscripts and Superscripts 

"=E = mc^{2}=" is exported as E = mc<sup>2</sup>. 
 
x<sub>1</sub><sup>2</sup> + x<sub>2</sub><sup>2</sup> = y<sup>2</sup>
 
x<sub>1</sub><sup>2</sup> + x<sub>2</sub><sup>2</sup> = y<sup>2</sup>
 

---+ About Quoting DocBook Code 

An Org file can quote DocBook XML code using one of the following constructs: 
 
<verbatim>
   #+DOCBOOK: Literal DocBook code for export

</verbatim>
or 
 
<verbatim>
   #+BEGIN_DOCBOOK
   All lines between these markers are exported literally.
   #+END_DOCBOOK

</verbatim>
Here are three examples (notice that the last one is a *warning* admonition in DocBook, something that Org-mode does not provide): 
 
_One line_ written in DocBook
 
Another paragraph written in DocBook XML code: E = mc<sup>2</sup>.
 
<note warning>
You should know what you are doing when quoting DocBook XML code   in your Org file.  Invalid DocBook XML file may be generated by   DocBook exporter if you are not careful!
 
</note>
This is a paragraph right after the DocBook code block, and should be wrapped into a paragraph. 
 

---+ About Text Centering 

=#+BEGIN_CENTER= ... =#+END_CENTER= is a newly added feature in Org-mode 6.24trans to support text centering.  This feature is currently supported via =&lt;informaltable&gt;= (with one row and one column) in DocBook exporter.  Element =&lt;para role="centered"&gt;= does not seem to work well with FOP. 
 
|Everything should be made as simple as possible, but not any simpler.

Repeat the above paragraph:

Everything should be made as simple as possible, but not any simpler.
 |
This is a paragraph right after the centered block, and should be wrapped into a paragraph. 
 

---+ Special Characters 

Special characters that are written in TeX-like syntax, such as =\alpha= (α), =\Gamma= (Γ), =\Zeta= (Ζ), and =\sigma= (σ), are supported by DocBook exporter.  These characters are rewritten to HTML entities like =&amp;alpha;=, =&amp;Gamma;=, =&amp;Zeta;=, and =&amp;sigma;=, so as long as the DocBook XML file includes the right entities, these special characters are recognized correctly. 
 
You can customize variable =org-export-docbook-doctype= to include the entities you need.  By default, this variable contains the following value: 
 
<verbatim>
    "<!DOCTYPE article [
    <!ENTITY % xhtml1-symbol PUBLIC
    \"-//W3C//ENTITIES Symbol for HTML//EN//XML\"
    \"http://www.w3.org/2003/entities/2007/xhtml1-symbol.ent\"
    >
    %xhtml1-symbol;
    ]>
    "

</verbatim>
For example, the following line in an Org file will generate this: α ≤ ∑ 2<sup>βγ</sup> + δ 
 
<verbatim>
    \alpha \le \sum 2^{\beta^{\gamma}} + \delta

</verbatim>
Characters like &lt;, &gt;, and &amp; should be exported as HTML entities.
